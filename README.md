This repo is dedicated to the development of a 3d game made in C. A project rank4 in 42lisbon school.
This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which
was the first FPS ever. It will enable us to explore ray-casting. Our goal will be to
make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which youâ€™ll have to find your way.
